# Versioning Policy (SemVer)

This project follows Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

Rules:
- **MAJOR**: breaking API changes.
- **MINOR**: new features, backwards compatible.
- **PATCH**: bug fixes, backwards compatible.

Pre-1.0:
- The project is in **0.x** (alpha). Breaking changes may occur in minor releases.
- We will still document breaking changes explicitly in release notes and the changelog.
